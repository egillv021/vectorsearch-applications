So I think consumer capitalism, and I'm going to speak pretty roughly here, but it fixates people on things that are, they're not purpose built to solve. So the reason that I think is this immersion in consumer capitalism is leading people away from their sense of purpose, and it's making them less happy, and it's putting them into a position where they're less capable of solving problems. So when I think about all of this, and I think about my goal, which is to hopefully contribute to human cooperation and solving the world's biggest problems, it's so interesting to me to think that if the things that you're talking about are true, and there is a way to design that in, that would be absolutely extraordinary. Now, I'm not saying that's true, but if it is, that could be extraordinary. And it would help us solve all of these big problems that otherwise seem to be quite intractable. So, I don't know. I'm definitely going to look further into all of this. Vishen, thank you so much for coming on the show. I know we didn't get to talk about a weighty of things, but this, I think, was really interesting. I'm going to encourage everybody listening to take a really deep dive into this, especially if there's information that could make you more capable of solving the world's biggest problems. That just seems absolutely extraordinary. So, Vishen, thank you so much for coming on the show. And guys, definitely take a look at the show notes.
